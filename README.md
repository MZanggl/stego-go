# stego-go

Hide messages in BMP images using steganography. stego-go uses a pseudo-random number generator (PRNG) based on a secret seed to randomly select pixel bits for embedding the hidden message. The message is first encrypted using AES and then encoded into the least significant bits (LSBs) of the image's pixel data. 

## Embed Message

```bash
go run main.go -method="embed" -in="./images/raw.bmp" -out="./images/embedded.bmp" -seed="my secret seed" -message="my hidden messageðŸ˜Š"
```

## Extract Message
```bash
go run main.go -method="extract" -in="./images/embedded.bmp" -seed="my secret seed"
# output: my hidden messageðŸ˜Š
```

## Notes

- This tool is intended for educational exploration of steganography.
- LSB embedding, despite pseudo-random distribution, can create detectable statistical anomalies in images.
- Detection reveals that a message might be concealed, even if the content remains unreadable.
- Even if the seed is compromised, the exact encryption and PRNG algorithms are still required for successful message extraction
